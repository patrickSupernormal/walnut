"""Log + task read tools (fn-10-60k.9 / T9).

Two tools, both read-only, both annotated
``ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=True, destructiveHint=False,
openWorldHint=False, idempotentHint=True)``:

* :func:`read_log` -- paginated entry-oriented access to
  ``_kernel/log.md`` with automatic spanning into
  ``_kernel/history/chapter-NN.md`` chapter files when the requested
  offset reaches beyond the active log. Unit of pagination is ENTRIES
  (one ``## <ISO-8601>`` heading = one entry), not bytes or lines.
  Entries are newest-first (the log is prepend-only on disk so file
  order equals age order); chapters are consumed in descending
  chapter number (newest chapter first).
* :func:`list_tasks` -- walnut- or bundle-scoped inventory of tasks
  from ``tasks.json`` files via
  :func:`alive_mcp._vendor._pure.tasks_pure._collect_all_tasks`.
  When ``bundle`` is supplied only that bundle's ``tasks.json`` is
  read; otherwise every ``tasks.json`` under the walnut (kernel-level
  + all bundles) contributes. Returns the merged list plus counts
  bucketed by priority/status exactly as the summary tool does.

Frozen contract (from the epic spec, reproduced so reviewers don't
need to cross-reference the task file):

Entry definition (log.md + chapter files)
-----------------------------------------
* An entry STARTS at a line matching the regex
  ``^## \\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}T\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}`` (ISO-8601 timestamp
  heading). The tail after the timestamp carries whatever label the
  session emitted ("-- squirrel:abc", etc.) -- we parse the squirrel
  id from it.
* The body extends FORWARD until the next matching heading OR a
  single-line ``---`` separator OR EOF, whichever comes first.
* Single-line ``---`` acts as a boundary marker between entries and
  is NOT part of the body.
* YAML frontmatter at the top of the file (delimited by
  ``---\\n...\\n---\\n``) is stripped before parsing entries. The
  frontmatter's closing ``---`` is NOT treated as an entry boundary.
* The trailing ``signed: squirrel:<id>`` line IS part of the entry
  body (we preserve it verbatim -- it's the attribution seal, not a
  boundary marker).

Ordering
--------
Newest-first. The log is prepend-only on disk so file order IS age
order (top = newest). ``offset=0`` returns the newest entry. When a
chapter boundary is crossed, we continue from chapter-``N`` (highest
number = newest chapter) and descend.

Pagination
----------
``offset`` skips entries (newest-first); ``limit`` caps entries
returned. When ``offset + limit`` exceeds the active log's entry count,
the tool auto-spans into the highest-numbered chapter file, then the
next-highest, etc., until ``limit`` is satisfied or all chapters are
exhausted. ``chapter_boundary_crossed`` is set to ``True`` when at
least one chapter entry appears in the returned window.

``next_offset = offset + len(returned_entries)`` when more entries
remain somewhere; ``None`` when the tool has exhausted both the
active log and every chapter.

Response shape
--------------
``read_log`` returns an envelope whose ``structuredContent`` is::

    {
      "entries": [{timestamp, walnut, squirrel_id, body, signed}, ...],
      "total_entries": int,             # combined log + chapters
      "total_chapters": int,
      "next_offset": int | None,
      "chapter_boundary_crossed": bool,
    }

``list_tasks`` returns::

    {
      "tasks": [ <raw tasks.json task dicts> ],
      "counts": {"urgent": int, "active": int, "todo": int,
                 "blocked": int, "done": int},
    }

Why a dedicated :func:`parse_log_entries` helper
------------------------------------------------
The vendored :func:`alive_mcp._vendor._pure.project_pure.parse_log`
is the *single-entry projection* used by the session-resume path: it
takes ``_kernel/log.md`` and synthesizes a `{context, phase, next,
bundle, squirrel}` dict from only the newest entry. Its output shape
doesn't match the list-of-entries contract we need here. Rather than
modify the vendored file (locked by the vendoring policy), we add a
local :func:`parse_log_entries` that returns the full entry list with
timestamp + squirrel_id + body + signed trailer.

Error posture
-------------
* ``ERR_NO_WORLD`` -- lifespan has not resolved a World yet.
* ``ERR_WALNUT_NOT_FOUND`` -- walnut path does not resolve (fuzzy
  suggestions layered on via the shared walnut error envelope).
* ``ERR_BUNDLE_NOT_FOUND`` -- bundle path does not resolve under the
  walnut (uses the shared bundle error envelope).
* ``ERR_PATH_ESCAPE`` -- walnut or bundle path would leave the World
  root after realpath resolution.
* ``ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED`` -- OS denies read on the log or a
  tasks.json file (the actual file path is redacted).
* A walnut with NO log and NO chapters is a legitimate fresh-walnut
  state -- we return ``{entries: [], total_entries: 0,
  total_chapters: 0, next_offset: None,
  chapter_boundary_crossed: False}`` rather than surfacing an error.
